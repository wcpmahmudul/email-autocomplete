This project provides a custom text box in .NET 2.0 that features advanced auto-complete functionality for use as an email address selector.

The class mimics most of the behavior seen in the Gmail "To:" text box, with a few slight differences.

NOTE: To run the example executable (AdvAutocompleteExample.exe) listed on the right, you'll also need to download the DLL (TextBoxEmailAutocomplete.dll) to the same directory.
